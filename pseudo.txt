1. A list dictionaries of questions and answers
        Each dictionary will have the question, the list of answers, the correct answer, and stored user answer
Store score variable
User answer variable
2. CorrectAnswerSelected
        Incrament score
3. IncorrectAnswer

4. nextQuestion
        set user answer to none
5. getUserChoice
        ask user to type letter
        Store user answer
          
6. displayQuestion
        go into questions list
        display question property from current index
        display answerAr property

7. answerIsCorrect
      Use conditionals to compare "correctAnswer" with "userChoice" 

8. userAnswerIsValid
      while userAnswer doesn't = a, b, or c:
          Prompt the user to type answer again

9. mainLoop

    Using iteration:
        Step 1: Add questions to "questions" list

    Using iteration:
        Step 2: Call displayQuestion()
        
        Step 3: Call getUserChoice()
        
        Step 4: Call answerIsCorrect()

10. Potential multiple answer feature:

        Implement multiple answer selections:
        Store "answerCount" for each question to determine how many answers the user needs to give

        In getUserChoice(), you prompt the user for multiple answers based off "answerCount"

            Store userAnswers in a list


        For checking the user answers being correct:
          Use a loop to compare each correct answer to each user answer

            If there are no matches
              The userAnswer is wrong
            Else 
            (if there is a match for each userAnswer)
              The userAnswer is correct
